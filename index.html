        <p>The photograph arrived <em>without explanation</em>.</p>
        
        <p>It showed some kind of mass. <strong>Dark grey and pulsating.</strong> It was hovering far above the North Atlantic. It resembled a cyclone but there was no eye of this storm, no rotation. Just layers. Like folds of gauze, stacked and suspended. The sky around it was <em>eerily clear</em>. That was the first impossibility.</p>
        
        <p>Dr. Mairead Finn saw the image at 6:32 a.m. It was forwarded to her personal account from an <strong>encrypted Ministry server</strong>. The subject line read only: <em>"Come in. Immediately."</em></p>
        
        <p>Dr. Finn arrived at the North Strand Climate Monitoring Facility before sunrise. The conference room was already full, unusual for a Wednesday.</p>
        
        <p>Technicians. Military liaisons. Two senior meteorologists and a man from the <strong>Department of Anomalous Phenomena</strong> â€” a department that, officially, <em>didn't exist</em>.</p>
        
        <p>No one spoke for the first ten minutes. They just stared at the image projected on the main wall, a still frame from a weather satellite feed.</p>
